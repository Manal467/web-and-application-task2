# Steps:
  1. Creating the basic structure:

      I started by creating a codeHome.html file that represents the basic structure of the site.
     I added the main sections such as header (for the menu), main (for the content), and footer (for the footer).
  2. Page formatting (CSS):

      After building the structure, I created a new file for styles .
      These styles express the appearance of the site, such as colors, fonts, and element placements.
     I added specific styles for the menu, sections, work images, and footer to make the site attractive.
  3. Adding interactive images:
     
     In the 'My Portfolio' section, I used HTML to create rectangles (div) containing images (img).
     I used CSS to turn these images into circular shapes and add effects when hovering over them.
     I made the images clickable by placing them inside the <a> tag.
  4. Adding the time function (JavaScript):
     
      To make the site dynamic, I added JavaScript code within the <script> tag at the end of the HTML file.
     This code retrieves the current time and updates it every second.
  5. Adding the footer section:
      
      Finally, I added the(footer)tag at the end of the HTML file, where we included contact information along with specific CSS styles.
